# ⚔️Lost and Stolen Weapons in Ukraine  (1991-2023)

https://ua-weapons.streamlit.app/

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I began working on this project at the end of 2021, when I stumbled upon **MIA** (Ministry of Internal Affairs) **of Ukraine** data, believing that it may potentially uncover how weapons theft and loss fit into the "terraforming" processes of the country as a political entity.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some peculiar changes occur throughout the history of Ukraine, which may or may not correlate with particular events, some of which I included in annotations on the histogram near the top of the webpage. Therefore, I would recommend viewing these annotations as time markers rather than events tied to the numbers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worth noting that this project is by no means a statistical analysis but rather a visual representation of the dataset, which some of you might find interesting, just as I did.
